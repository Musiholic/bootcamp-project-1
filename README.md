Branch Corbin

	This branch signifies what keys are most popular within the listing of the top (non-error) 1500 songs
from Spotify. We found that the majority, by a few hundred songs, of popular songs are in a major key. 
While the key signature of a song is not imperative; there is an obvious love for 'C#/Db' and a dislike for 
'D#/Eb'. The rest of the key signatures remain at a relatively balanced liking. Finally, we find there to be a
strong like for medium to medium-high energy songs. Thus we can conclude that the most popular songs are tending
towards a medium-high energy song in 'C#/Db' Major.

#From Branch-Joss Investigation
Do Song Lyric Count/Variety correlate to the popularity of a song?
For the data, we counted the lyrics of all the songs, and counted the unique lyrics of all the songs. Additionally, those counts were compared to lyric count and unique lyric count for Popular Songs, meaning songs that peaked in the Top 10.
For the lyric count for all songs, the Mean: 335.8233690873923, Median: 332.0, Mode: 0, Variance: 67599.5937877889, Standard Deviation: 259.99921882149744.
(Plots found in Cell 11 of lyrics3.pynb)
For the lyric count of popular songs, the Mean: 366.2063615205586, Median: 377.0, Mode: 0, Variance: 75441.62974210842, Standard Deviation: 274.66639718412665.
(Plots found in Cell 14 of lyrics3.pynb)
This indicates that popular music actually has a higher lyric count than music as a whole. This could be due to the genre of songs popularized in todays culture, however, that research was not done here.
For unique lyrics, for all songs, Mean: 135.8066643221382, Median: 123.0, Mode: 0, Variance: 12301.276871084097, Standard Deviation: 110.91112149412292.
((Plots found in Cell 17 of lyrics3.pynb)
For unique lyrics, for popular songs, Mean: 148.58494957331266, Median: 139.0, Mode: 0, Variance: 13549.41533231497, Standard Deviation: 116.40195587839136.
Again, popular music is using more unique words, than songs as a whole.
Caveat to this finding, I kept in songs with 0 lyrics, some of these are 0 because of error, some are 0 because they have no lyrics, it is possible that fully cleaning the data that these findings may change. For this reason, the distribution tables are all bimodal.
This distribution charts of the formerly discussed data can be found here:

Do the most popular artists have more Top 10 hits than other artists?
