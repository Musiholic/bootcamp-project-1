# Main Branch

Branch Corbin

	This branch signifies what keys are most popular within the listing of the top (non-error) 1500 songs
from Spotify. We found that the majority, by a few hundred songs, of popular songs are in a major key. 
While the key signature of a song is not imperative; there is an obvious love for 'C#/Db' and a dislike for 
'D#/Eb'. The rest of the key signatures remain at a relatively balanced liking. Finally, we find there to be a
strong like for medium to medium-high energy songs. Thus we can conclude that the most popular songs are tending
towards a medium-high energy song in 'C#/Db' Major.
